# Kleckner_CSCI2270_FinalProject
This is for the final project in CSCI 2270
/*
Project Summery:
This program is an updated version of Assignment 4, where we used a linked list of "towers" to transfer a message from city to city. Instead, I will be adding changing the linked List to a graph, and allow the user to choose the message that they are sending. By using the Graph style instead of the linked List, the Program will be able to calculate the shortest path to send message through both number of cities and distance. Similar to Assignment 8, I will be seperating the cities into districts.
